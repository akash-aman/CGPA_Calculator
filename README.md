## **Idea about building this Project**

- Calculating CGPA is some time irritating 🤓 so thought of building one Application which include User Interactivity ❤️ & user Flexiblity . 
- Developing this app using ⚛️ React & Redux was fun & challenging.
- Main logic of this app is in `state/cgpaSlice.js` file.
- A much interactive UI💻, we can add more subjects, remove subjects, change the subjects marks💯, even add & remove semesters Card etc.
